# Mental-fitness tracker

A mental fitness tracker that uses a regression algorithm could analyze data and make predictions about an individualâ€™s mental fitness.
Used Linear Regression and XGBoost Regressor models to predict the mental fitness of an individual.

XGBoost is an open-source library that provides an efficient and effective implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm. It is a powerful approach for building supervised regression models. The XGBoost regressor trains an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions on continuous numerical data.
